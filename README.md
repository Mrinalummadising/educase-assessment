### Build a News App using React Native that fetches news articles from a public API (e.g., NewsAPI) and displays them in a pixel-perfect UI based on the provided Figma design. 
### Requirements  

### Pixel-Perfect UI Implementation

Implement the UI design provided in the Figma link using React Native components.
Pay attention to details such as spacing, typography, colors, and overall layout to achieve pixel-perfect fidelity to the design.

### Data Fetching
Utilize Axios (or any preferred HTTP client) to fetch news articles from a public API (e.g. NewsAPI).
Display the fetched news articles in the app based on the design requirements.

### Navigation
Implement navigation between different screens as per the design (e.g., Home screen, Article detail screen).
Ensure smooth transitions and user experience.

### Steps
Set Up the Project
Initialize a new React Native project.
Set up necessary dependencies (e.g., Axios for HTTP requests, React Navigation for navigation).

### Implement UI Components
Create the necessary React Native components to match the UI design.
Use appropriate layout components (e.g., View, Text, Image, ScrollView) to structure the app screens.

### Fetch Data
Integrate Axios to make API requests to fetch news articles.
Handle API responses and update the app state accordingly.

### Display News Articles
Render the fetched news articles in the designated sections of the UI.
Ensure that each article item links to a detailed view (article detail screen) when clicked.

### Navigation
Implement navigation between screens using React Navigation.
Set up appropriate navigation stacks and routes.
Testing and Finalization
Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly.
Verify that the UI matches the provided design.
Make any necessary adjustments to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy.
